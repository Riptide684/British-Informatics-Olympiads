# British-Informatics-Olympiads
Solutions to past BIO1 problems

I've posted some of my solutions to some problems from round 1 of the British Informatics Olympiad.
They're all writtenn in Python, because it's easier to code in under time pressure than Java and c++.
Some problems have mulitple solutions using different methods, and some don't fully function for large inputs.
